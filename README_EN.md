## 👋 Hello!

➡️ **[日本語で表示する](README.md)** ⬅️

With a passion for Linux and system development, I am currently working on multiple projects using **Arch Linux** as my main environment. In the past, I gained extensive experience in system development using Java and Oracle. Currently, I am taking on the challenge of learning C++ while working on a custom IME for Japanese input.

### 🔧 Skill Set
- **Languages**: Python, Bash, zsh, Java (EJB, Servlet, JSP), C
- **Technologies**: Arch Linux, Systemd, Neovim, Git, ElasticSearch, Oracle, DB2
- **Tools**: Eclipse, TeraTerm, rsync, cron, NetBackUp
- **Operating Systems**: Solaris, Windows, Ubuntu (Backup environment setup on mini PC)

### 🚀 Ongoing Main Projects
- **OS Development**: Developing a custom OS - Learning low-level system programming and building from the ground up.
- **Custom IME Creation**: Creating a Japanese input IME in C++ - Aiming to provide a smooth Japanese typing experience.
- **Programming Language Creation**: Developing a new programming language - Designing a language tailored to specific needs.
- **Arch Linux Backup Project**: Setting up a backup environment on a mini PC - Implementing reliable backups with rsync and cron.
- **Scrapbox Full-Text Search**: Building a cross-project full-text search system for Scrapbox using ElasticSearch.

### 🎯 Goals
I aim to deepen my knowledge in system programming and low-level development, with a particular focus on enhancing my C++ skills to take on broader projects. Additionally, I hope to share my advanced knowledge in system development by drawing on my past experiences.
